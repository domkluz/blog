@app.route("/")
@app.route("/page/<int:page>")

My understanding of decroators are such that it will start with inner most first
therefore will start with @app.route("/page/<int:page>")
So how does it work that when I first start the app it foes to "/"
So how does it skip the first decortor

THIS WON'T WORK
href = "{{url_for('view_entry',article_id = {{entry.id}} )}}"

THIS WILL WORK. I THINK BECAUSE THERE ARE ALREADY OUTER BRACKETS PRESENT
href = "{{url_for('view_entry',article_id = entry.id )}}"

When trying to delete record try and use methods=["DELETE"]) - have to leave blank? why?
I tried all other post/get/put/delete and none worked except for blank


<span>
    <form method = "link" formaction = "/entry/47/delete">
        <input type = "submit" value = "Yes" method="POST" name = "button-yes">
        <input type = "submit" value = "No" method="POST" name = "button-no">
    </form>
</span>    


sudo service postgresql start

Use action in the form to redirect i.e. with url_for do not use formaction - will not work
If you use form method = link then it amends the link, and doesn't redirect you. i.e. 
I think it bascially adds onto the current link so if you have dom/kluz
You can then add dom/kluz/page1 for example

In a button you use formaction not action.
