@app.route("/")
@app.route("/page/<int:page>")

My understanding of decroators are such that it will start with inner most first
therefore will start with @app.route("/page/<int:page>")
So how does it work that when I first start the app it foes to "/"
So how does it skip the first decortor

THIS WON'T WORK
href = "{{url_for('view_entry',article_id = {{entry.id}} )}}"

THIS WILL WORK. I THINK BECAUSE THERE ARE ALREADY OUTER BRACKETS PRESENT
href = "{{url_for('view_entry',article_id = entry.id )}}"

When trying to delete record try and use methods=["DELETE"]) - have to leave blank? why?
I tried all other post/get/put/delete and none worked except for blank
